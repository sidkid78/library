The platform is strategically positioned to capitalize on the rapidly expanding "AgeTech" market by addressing a critical gap between homeowner needs and contractor access. A foundational strategic pivot from a full-service provider to a pure-play lead generation model underpins the business, prioritizing speed-to-market, capital efficiency, and immediate revenue realization. The platform's core innovation is its proprietary Augmented Reality (AR) assessment tool. This technology allows homeowners to perform simple scans of their homes, which are then analyzed by Google Gemini to identify accessibility hazards and recommend modifications. A separate AI service, Fal.ai, generates "after" visualizations, providing users with a clear understanding of potential improvements. This process yields high-intent, pre-qualified leads with detailed project scopes, offering significantly higher value and conversion potential for contractors compared to general home service platforms. The market opportunity is substantial, with the home modification market projected to reach $161 billion by 2030, fueled by powerful demographic trends, including over 10,000 Americans turning 65 daily and an overwhelming preference (75-87%) among seniors to age in their own homes. The platform's go-to-market strategy involves a phased geographic rollout, beginning with Texas and Florida, and a significant opportunity to partner with federal grant programs, most notably the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Older Adults Home Modification Program (OAHMP). Technologically, HOMEase | AI is built on a serverless, event-driven architecture hosted entirely on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The stack includes a Next.js 16.0.10 application deployed on Google Cloud Run, a suite of backend services using Google Cloud Functions, and a data layer managed by Firebase, ensuring scalability, security, and operational efficiency.

Business Strategy & Market Opportunity 1.1. The Strategic Pivot to Lead Generation HOMEase | AI’s business model is the result of a deliberate pivot from an original vision of a vertically integrated, full-service provider to a focused, pure-play lead generation platform. The initial concept would have involved managing the entire modification process, from assessment to project management and construction. This was determined to be too slow, capital-intensive, and operationally complex. The current strategy centers on excelling at a single, high-value function: generating exceptionally qualified leads. As one planning document states, "We’re not trying to be the general contractor of America. We’re the AI engine that finds the work and feeds it to the people already doing the work." Rationale and Advantages: • Rapid Market Entry: A technology-focused model allows for national scalability without the need to establish physical construction teams in each city. • Capital Efficiency: The asset-light model avoids the significant costs associated with labor, equipment, and physical infrastructure. • Accelerated Revenue Realization: Revenue is generated immediately on a pay-per-lead basis, providing a faster path to monetization and profitability. • Scalable Growth: The digital platform is designed to leverage a compounding flywheel effect: more AR scans generate more high-quality leads, which attract more contractors, enhancing the platform's value and attracting more users. 1.2. Market Opportunity and Validation The market for aging-in-place solutions is validated by powerful demographic shifts and a significant structural gap in the U.S. housing market.

Platform Features and User Flows The platform is a comprehensive ecosystem designed for homeowners, contractors, and administrators. The core workflow begins with the homeowner's AR assessment and culminates in a successful project completion. Homeowner Journey:

AR Assessment: The user selects a room and uses their device's camera to capture images. AI Analysis & Visualization: The app provides an AI-generated analysis from Google Gemini, including an accessibility score (0-100), a list of specific issues (e.g., narrow doorways), and recommendations. Fal.ai generates a visualization of the proposed changes. Lead Creation: The user reviews the report, sets an urgency level (Low, Medium, High) and budget, and submits the project as a lead. Contractor Matching: The platform automatically matches the lead with vetted, qualified local contractors. Communication & Selection: The homeowner communicates with matched contractors via an integrated messaging system and selects their preferred professional. Payment & Review: Secure payments are processed through Stripe, and the homeowner leaves a review upon project completion. Key Platform Features: User Role Key Features Homeowners AR-based assessments, AI-driven recommendations, automated contractor matching, real-time messaging, secure payment processing, project tracking. Contractors Professional profiles, management of high-quality leads, a Dynamic Scope Builder to auto-generate proposals from AR data, secure payment collection. Administrators A comprehensive dashboard for managing the contractor approval process, user accounts, and platform analytics. 2.2. Technical Architecture The platform is architected for scalability, security, and performance using a serverless-first approach on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). • High-Level Model: A serverless, event-driven architecture that decouples the frontend application from backend processing. • Technology Stack: ◦ Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) deployed on Google Cloud Run, containerized via Docker. ◦ Backend: A suite of serverless Google Cloud Functions for handling API requests, background tasks, and business logic. ◦ Database: Firebase Firestore, a scalable NoSQL real-time database. ◦ Authentication: Firebase Authentication integrated with NextAuth.js v5. User roles are managed via Firebase Custom Claims. ◦ Storage: Google Cloud Storage (via Firebase) for images and documents. ◦ Messaging Bus: Google Cloud Pub/Sub for triggering asynchronous workflows. ◦ Payments: Stripe Connect for contractor onboarding and Stripe Checkout for transactions. ◦ DevOps: A CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with secure, keyless authentication to GCP via Workload Identity Federation. • AR Implementation Strategy: The plan prioritizes a native mobile application (using ARKit/ARCore) to leverage device LiDAR for the most accurate measurements, with a WebXR-based version as a more accessible fallback. • Asynchronous Workflows: Core processes like AR analysis and contractor matching are handled asynchronously. For example, a homeowner submitting a lead receives an immediate response, while a lead-created message is published to Pub/Sub, triggering a Cloud Function to perform the matching algorithm without blocking the user interface.
